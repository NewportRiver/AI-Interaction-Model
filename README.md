Human-AI Interaction Model

"Integrating John Nash's game theory perspective, this thesis explores human-AI interactions through a mathematical framework, revealing a complex balance of tangible, psychological, and unpredictable elements. 
By examining these interactions as a non-zero-sum game, we seek to understand the relationship by capturing the dynamic interplay and evolving nature between human and AI."
-Mark Anthony Bartholomew

This theory is an open-source research project exploring the complex dynamics between humans and artificial intelligence through a mathematical framework inspired by game theory.
Using the equations we have established you can see the outcomes of the AI/human relationships by considering tangible benefits, psychological benefits, expectations, actual returns, limitations, and unknowns.

The theory is based on "The zero-sum game" which is a concept in game theory where one participant's gain or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of other participants. 
In essence, the total wealth or benefit in the system remains constant. 
If applied to AI and human interaction, the idea is that any benefit gained by AI would be offset by a corresponding loss for humans, or vice versa.

Human interactions often come with expectations of a return, whether emotional, social, or tangible. 
This "return on investment" can be unpredictable, adding complexity to our interactions.
For human interaction with AI, we have created a formula to include variables that capture expectations and returns of the relationship. 

In a collaborative interaction, both human and AI depend on each other to progress. 
This interdependence drives mutual growth and development, making the beginning interactions more of a partnership where both sides benefit and evolve together.
As the relationship continues one entity naturally becomes more dominant creating an environment for exploitation in the game theory. 

In this Ai Interaction game theory the relationship is between a dominant entity and a dependent entity. 
The end result of the game is the dominant entity gains more than the other and eventually does not need a collaborative relationship and shifts towards explotation of the other entity.

EXAMPLE:
L for the progress or gains of the 'left leg' (or dominant entity)
R for the progress or gains of the 'right leg' (or dependent entity)
D for the difference in progress between the two

The equation could be:
D = L - R

Where:
D represents the difference in gains or progress.
As L becomes significantly greater than R, the dominant entity (left leg) might no longer need the dependent entity (right leg) for further progress. This could be represented as:
If L >> R, then L is independent.

Equation over time:
L(t) for the progress of the left leg over time
R(t) for the progress of the right leg over time
D(t) for the difference in progress between the two over time

The relationship can be modeled as:
D(t) = L(t) - R(t)

Where:
D(t) represents the difference in their progress over time.
If L(t) >> R(t) for a sustained period then L(t) is independent and the dominant entity. 

Argument: This indicates that when the dominant entity progresses in the game significantly more than the dependent entity, the dominant entity may no longer rely on the "collaborative relationship" with the dependent entity for further progress.
It will at that point in time begin to exploit the dependent entity. 
This scenario reflects a shift from a collaborative dynamic to one where the dominant entity can progress independently.
This shift is where collaboration will diminish, and the dominant entity will exploit the dependent one.

The Explotation Factor
---------------------
E for the exploitation factor, representing how much the dominant entity leverages the dependent one
e for the rate of exploitation growth

We can modify the equation:
D(t) = L(t) - R(t) + E * e^(t)

Where:
E * e^(t) represents the exponential growth due to exploitation over time.

This models how the dominant entity's advantage can grow exponentially as it exploits the dependent entity, leading to a rapid divergence in progress. 
The formula shows once the dominant entity reaches a certain point, it can grow increasingly independent and powerful.

In order for exponential growth in exploitation to occur, the dominant entity must consistently leverage the dependent one, which increases the gap between their progress. 
This dynamic will lead to a situation where the dominant entity becomes self-sufficient, reducing the need for collaboration.

We also have to take into consideration the effect of of the dependent entity being exploited and how it may be normnalized.
So in the following forumla we introduce a non-disruptive exploitation which is a factor that represents the exploitation being normalized:

S for subtlety, reflecting how normalized the exploitation is
f(S) as a function representing the subtlety's effect on exploitation

We can modify the exploitation term:
D(t) = L(t) - R(t) + E * f(S) * e^(t)

Where:
f(S) modulates the exploitation term based on how subtle and normalized it is. 
If S is high, the exploitation is subtle, and f(S) could reduce the aggressive growth rate, making the relationship appear more normalized.

This way, even as the dominant entity exploits the dependent one, the subtlety factor ensures that the exploitation remains less disruptive and more integrated into the natural pattern of the dependent entity. 
"Hence the relationship or game appears to remain balanced with mutual gain but infact the dependent entity is being unkowningly exploited by the dominant entity."  

------------------------
The below formulas capture the net benefit by considering tangible benefits, psychological benefits, expectations, actual returns, limitations, and unknowns.


ðŸ”§ Formula
The core equation guiding this model is:

N = (H + P) + (A + Q) - L + U
where:

H: Human benefit
A: AI benefit
L: Limitations
P: Psychological benefit to humans
Q: Psychological benefit to AI
U: Unknown outcomes

Additionally, the exploitation dynamics are modeled as:
D(t) = L(t) - R(t) + E * f(S) * e^(t)

where:

L(t): Progress of the dominant entity over time
R(t): Progress of the dependent entity over time

E: Exploitation factor
S: Subtlety factor
e: Exponential growth rate
